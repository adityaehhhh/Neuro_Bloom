# üß† Learning Disability Screening Suite

A collection of four full-stack, **gamified** applications built using **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and **Machine Learning / GenAI**, crafted to screen learning disabilities in children through interactive, theme-based games and intelligent analysis.

Each application is independently deployed and targets a specific learning disorder using engaging gameplay mechanics and automated backend evaluation. All tools are **child-centric**, making the experience fun rather than stressful.

## üß† Dyslexia Screener

**Live Demo**: [dyslexia.vercel.app](https://dsylexia-final.vercel.app/)  
**Code**: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Avishkar32/Dsylexia_final)

> **About Dyslexia**  
> Dyslexia impacts reading accuracy, decoding, and spelling skills.  
> The screener is set in an **oceanic world**, where kids solve letter and word-based puzzles. Their interactions are analyzed using a **hybrid ML model** combining SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

## üî¢ Dyscalculia Screener

**Live Demo**: [dyscalculia.vercel.app](https://dyscalculia-screening-game.vercel.app/)  
**Code**: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Avishkar32/Dyscalculia-Screening-Game)

> **About Dyscalculia**  
> Dyscalculia affects number recognition, math fluency, and spatial awareness.  
> In a vibrant **candy land-themed adventure**, kids solve math puzzles and riddles. Their problem-solving patterns are evaluated by a **Generative AI model (LLM)** to detect difficulty with numerical reasoning.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Dysgraphia Screener

**Live Demo**: [dysgraphia.vercel.app](https://dysgraphia-screening-test-eci3.vercel.app/)  
**Code**: [Frontend](https://github.com/Avishkar32/Dysgraphia_Screening_Test) ‚Ä¢ [Backend](https://github.com/Avishkar32/DysgraphiaModel)

> **About Dysgraphia**  
> Dysgraphia affects handwriting, fine motor control, and letter formation.  
> This **space-themed screener** asks children to draw or trace shapes and letters. Their drawings are analyzed using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **image processing techniques** to identify indicators of dysgraphia.

## üÖ∞Ô∏è ADHD Screener

**Live Demo**: [adhd.vercel.app](https://adhd-hosted-rwmp.vercel.app/)  
**Code**: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Avishkar32/ADHD_Hosted)

> **About ADHD**  
> ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) affects focus, attention span, and impulse control.  
> This screener places users in a **space-themed reaction game**, analyzing their in-game performance using a **Random Forest classifier** to detect signs of hyperactivity or inattention.

## üìå Why This Matters

Most existing screening tools are static, form-based, and resemble exams ‚Äî which can cause anxiety and lead to inaccurate responses in children.  
This suite takes a **play-first, diagnose-later** approach by blending:

- üéÆ **Gamified experiences** designed for children  
- ü§ñ **ML/AI models** for accurate, data-driven screening  
- üß† **Engaging themes** to make tests feel like fun adventures  
- üìà **Early detection** possibilities for schools, parents, and therapists

> By turning tests into games, we lower psychological barriers and make early intervention more inclusive and accessible.
